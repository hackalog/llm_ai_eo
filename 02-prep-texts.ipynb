# Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence\",\"passage: By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:\",\"passage: Section 1.\\u00a0 Purpose.\\u00a0 Artificial intelligence (AI) holds extraordinary potential for both promise and peril.\\u00a0 Responsible AI use has the potential to help solve urgent challenges while making our world more prosperous, productive, innovative, and secure.\\u00a0 At the same time, irresponsible use could exacerbate societal harms such as fraud, discrimination, bias, and disinformation; displace and disempower workers; stifle competition; and pose risks to national security.\\u00a0 Harnessing AI for good and realizing its myriad benefits requires mitigating its substantial risks.\\u00a0 This endeavor demands a society-wide effort that includes government, the private sector, academia, and civil society.\",\"passage: My Administration places the highest urgency on governing the development and use of AI safely and responsibly, and is therefore advancing a coordinated, Federal Government-wide approach to doing so.\\u00a0The rapid speed at which AI capabilities are advancing compels the United States to lead in this moment for the sake of our security, economy, and society.\",\"passage: In the end, AI reflects the principles of the people who build it, the people who use it, and the data upon which it is built.\\u00a0 I firmly believe that the power of our ideals; the foundations of our society; and the creativity, diversity, and decency of our people are the reasons that America thrived in past eras of rapid change.\\u00a0 They are the reasons we will succeed again in this moment.\\u00a0 We are more than capable of harnessing AI for justice, security, and opportunity for all.\",\"passage: Sec.2.\\u00a0 Policy and Principles.\\u00a0 It is the policy of my Administration to advance and govern the development and use of AI in accordance with eight guiding principles and priorities.\\u00a0 When undertaking the actions set forth in this order, executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, adhere to these principles, while, as feasible, taking into account the views of other agencies, industry, members of academia, civil society, labor unions, international allies and partners, and other relevant organizations:\",\"passage: (a)\\u00a0 Artificial Intelligence must be safe and secure.\\u00a0 Meeting this goal requires robust, reliable, repeatable, and standardized evaluations of AI systems, as well as policies, institutions, and, as appropriate, other mechanisms to test, understand, and mitigate risks from these systems before they are put to use.\\u00a0 It also requires addressing AI systems\\u2019 most pressing security risks \\u2014 including with respect to biotechnology, cybersecurity, critical infrastructure, and other national security dangers \\u2014 while navigating AI\\u2019s opacity and complexity.\\u00a0 Testing and evaluations, including post-deployment performance monitoring, will help ensure that AI systems function as intended, are resilient against misuse or dangerous modifications, are ethically developed and operated in a secure manner, and are compliant with applicable Federal laws and policies.\\u00a0 Finally, my Administration will help develop effective labeling and content provenance mechanisms, so that Americans are able to determine when content is generated using AI and when it is not.\\u00a0 These actions will provide a vital foundation for an approach that addresses AI\\u2019s risks without unduly reducing its benefits.\",\"passage: (b)\\u00a0 Promoting responsible innovation, competition, and collaboration will allow the United States to lead in AI and unlock the technology\\u2019s potential to solve some of society\\u2019s most difficult challenges.\\u00a0 This effort requires investments in AI-related education, training, development, research, and capacity, while simultaneously tackling novel intellectual property (IP) questions and other problems to protect inventors and creators.\\u00a0 Across the Federal Government, my Administration will support programs to provide Americans the skills they need for the age of AI and attract the world\\u2019s AI talent to our shores \\u2014 not just to study, but to stay \\u2014 so that the companies and technologies of the future are made in America.\\u00a0 The Federal Government will promote a fair, open, and competitive ecosystem and marketplace for AI and related technologies so that small developers and entrepreneurs can continue to drive innovation.\\u00a0 Doing so requires stopping unlawful collusion and addressing risks from dominant firms\\u2019 use of key assets such as semiconductors, computing power, cloud storage, and data to disadvantage competitors, and it requires supporting a marketplace that harnesses the benefits of AI to provide new opportunities for small businesses, workers, and entrepreneurs.\",\"passage: (c)\\u00a0 The responsible development and use of AI require a commitment to supporting American workers.\\u00a0 As AI creates new jobs and industries, all workers need a seat at the table, including through collective bargaining, to ensure that they benefit from these opportunities.\\u00a0 My Administration will seek to adapt job training and education to support a diverse workforce and help

2023\",\"passage: Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents enormous global opportunities: it has the potential to transform and enhance human wellbeing, peace and prosperity.To realise this, we affirm that, for the good of all,\\u00a0AI\\u00a0should be designed, developed, deployed, and used, in a manner that is safe, in such a way as to be human-centric, trustworthy and responsible.We welcome the international community\\u2019s efforts so far to cooperate on\\u00a0AI\\u00a0to promote inclusive economic growth, sustainable development and innovation, to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms, and to foster public trust and confidence in\\u00a0AI\\u00a0systems to fully realise their potential.\",\"passage: AI\\u00a0systems are already deployed across many domains of daily life including housing, employment, transport, education, health, accessibility, and justice, and their use is likely to increase.We recognise that this is therefore a unique moment to act and affirm the need for the safe development of\\u00a0AI\\u00a0and for the transformative opportunities of\\u00a0AIto be used for good and for all, in an inclusive manner in our countries and globally.This includes for public services such as health and education, food security, in science, clean energy, biodiversity, and climate, to realise the enjoyment of human rights, and to strengthen efforts towards the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\",\"passage: Alongside these opportunities,\\u00a0AI\\u00a0also poses significant risks, including in those domains of daily life.To that end, we welcome relevant international efforts to examine and address the potential impact of\\u00a0AI\\u00a0systems in existing fora and other relevant initiatives, and the recognition that the protection of human rights, transparency and explainability, fairness, accountability, regulation, safety, appropriate human oversight, ethics, bias mitigation, privacy and data protection needs to be addressed.We also note the potential for unforeseen risks stemming from the capability to manipulate content or generate deceptive content.All of these issues are critically important and we affirm the necessity and urgency of addressing them.\",\"passage: Particular safety risks arise at the \\u2018frontier\\u2019 of\\u00a0AI, understood as being those highly capable general-purpose\\u00a0AI\\u00a0models, including foundation models, that could perform a wide variety of tasks - as well as relevant specific narrow\\u00a0AI\\u00a0that could exhibit capabilities that cause harm - which match or exceed the capabilities present in today\\u2019s most advanced models.Substantial risks may arise from potential intentional misuse or unintended issues of control relating to alignment with human intent.These issues are in part because those capabilities are not fully understood and are therefore hard to predict.We are especially concerned by such risks in domains such as cybersecurity and biotechnology, as well as where frontier\\u00a0AI\\u00a0systems may amplify risks such as disinformation.There is potential for serious, even catastrophic, harm, either deliberate or unintentional, stemming from the most significant capabilities of these\\u00a0AI\\u00a0models.Given the rapid and uncertain rate of change of\\u00a0AI, and in the context of the acceleration of investment in technology, we affirm that deepening our understanding of these potential risks and of actions to address them is especially urgent.\",\"passage: Many risks arising from\\u00a0AI\\u00a0are inherently international in nature, and so are best addressed through international cooperation.We resolve to work together in an inclusive manner to ensure human-centric, trustworthy and responsible\\u00a0AI\\u00a0that is safe, and supports the good of all through existing international fora and other relevant initiatives, to promote cooperation to address the broad range of risks posed by\\u00a0AI.In doing so,\\u00a0we recognise\\u00a0that countries should consider the importance of a pro-innovation and proportionate governance\\u00a0and regulatory\\u00a0approach that maximises the benefits and takes into account the risks associated with\\u00a0AI.\\u00a0This could include making, where appropriate, classifications and categorisations of risk based on national circumstances and applicable legal frameworks.\\u00a0We also note the relevance of cooperation, where appropriate, on approaches such as common principles and\\u00a0codes\\u00a0of conduct.With regard to the specific risks most likely found in relation to frontier\\u00a0AI, we resolve to intensify and sustain our cooperation, and broaden it with further countries, to identify, understand and as appropriate act, through existing international fora and other relevant initiatives, including future international\\u00a0AI\\u00a0Safety Summits.\",\"passage: All actors have a role to play in ensuring the safety of\\u00a0AI: nations, international fora and other initiatives, companies, civil society and academia will need to work together.Noting the importance of inclusive\\u00a0AI\\u00a0and bridging the digital divide, we reaffirm that international collaboration should endeavour to engage and involve a broad range of partners as appropriate, and welcome development-orientated approaches and policies that could help developing countries strengthen\\u00a0AI\\u00a0capacity building and leverage the enabling role of\\u00a0AI\\u00a0to support sustainable growth and address the development gap.\",\"passage: We affirm that, whilst safety must be considered across the\\u00a0AI\\u00a0lifecycle, actors developing frontier\\u00a0AI\\u00a0capabilities, in particular those\\u00a0AI\\u00a0systems which are unusually powerful and potentially harmful, have a particularly strong responsibility for ensuring the safety of these\\u00a0AI\\u00a0systems, including through systems for safety testing, through evaluations, and by other appropriate measures.We encourage all relevant actors to provide context-appropriate transparency and accountability on their plans to measure, monitor and mitigate potentially harmful capabilities and the associated effects that may emerge, in particular to prevent misuse and issues of control, and the amplification of other risks.\",\"passage: In the context of our cooperation, and to inform action at the national and international levels, our agenda for addressing frontier\\u00a0AI\\u00a0risk will focus on:\",\"passage: - identifying\\u00a0AI\\u00a0safety risks of shared concern, building a shared scientific and evidence-based understanding of these risks, and sustaining that understanding as capabilities continue to increase, in the context of a wider global approach to understanding the impact of\\u00a0AI\\u00a0in our societies.\",\"passage: - building respective risk-based policies across our countries to ensure safety in light of such risks, collaborating as appropriate while recognising our approaches may differ based on national circumstances and applicable legal frameworks.This includes, alongside increased transparency by private actors developing frontier\\u00a0AIcapabilities, appropriate evaluation metrics, tools for safety testing, and developing relevant public sector capability and scientific research.\",\"passage: In furtherance of this agenda, we resolve to support an internationally inclusive network of scientific research on frontier\\u00a0AI\\u00a0safety that encompasses and complements existing and new multilateral, plurilateral and bilateral collaboration, including through existing international fora and other relevant initiatives, to facilitate the provision of the best science available for policy making and the public good.\",\"passage: In recognition of the transformative positive potential of\\u00a0AI, and as part of ensuring wider international cooperation on\\u00a0AI, we resolve to sustain an inclusive global dialogue that engages existing international fora and other relevant initiatives and contributes in an open manner to broader international discussions, and to continue research on frontier\\u00a0AI\\u00a0safety to ensure that the benefits of the technology can be harnessed responsibly for good and for all.We look forward to meeting again in 2024.\",\"passage: The countries represented were:\",\"passage: - Australia\",\"passage: - Brazil\",\"passage: -

Executive Order on the Safe,\\nSecure, and Trustworthy\\nDevelopment and Use of\\nArtificial Intelligenc\",\"By the authority vested in me as\\nPresident by the Constitution\\nand the laws of the United\\nStates of America, it is hereby\\nordered as follow\",\"Section 1.\\u00a0 Purpose.\\u00a0 Artificial\\nintelligence (AI) holds\\nextraordinary potential for both\\npromise and peril.\\u00a0 Responsible\\nAI use has the potential to help\\nsolve urgent challenges while\\nmaking our world more\\nprosperous, productive,\\ninnovative, and secure.\\u00a0 At the\\nsame time, irresponsible use\\ncould exacerbate societal harms\\nsuch as fraud, discrimination,\\nbias, and disinformation;\\ndisplace and disempower workers;\\nstifle competition; and pose\\nrisks to national security.\\u00a0\\nHarnessing AI for good and\\nrealizing its myriad benefits\\nrequires mitigating its\\nsubstantial risks.\\u00a0 This\\nendeavor demands a society-wide\\neffort that includes government,\\nthe private sector, academia,\\nand civil society.\",\"My Administration places the\\nhighest urgency on governing the\\ndevelopment and use of AI safely\\nand responsibly, and is\\ntherefore advancing a\\ncoordinated, Federal Government-\\nwide approach to doing so.\\u00a0The\\nrapid speed at which AI\\ncapabilities are advancing\\ncompels the United States to\\nlead in this moment for the sake\\nof our security, economy, and\\nsociety.\",\"In the end, AI reflects the\\nprinciples of the people who\\nbuild it, the people who use it,\\nand the data upon which it is\\nbuilt.\\u00a0 I firmly believe that\\nthe power of our ideals; the\\nfoundations of our society; and\\nthe creativity, diversity, and\\ndecency of our people are the\\nreasons that America thrived in\\npast eras of rapid change.\\u00a0 They\\nare the reasons we will succeed\\nagain in this moment.\\u00a0 We are\\nmore than capable of harnessing\\nAI for justice, security, and\\nopportunity for all.\",\"Sec.2.\\u00a0 Policy and Principles.\\u00a0\\nIt is the policy of my\\nAdministration to advance and\\ngovern the development and use\\nof AI in accordance with eight\\nguiding principles and\\npriorities.\\u00a0 When undertaking\\nthe actions set forth in this\\norder, executive departments and\\nagencies (agencies) shall, as\\nappropriate and consistent with\\napplicable law, adhere to these\\nprinciples, while, as feasible,\\ntaking into account the views of\\nother agencies, industry,\\nmembers of academia, civil\\nsociety, labor unions,\\ninternational allies and\\npartners, and other relevant\\norganization\",\"(a)\\u00a0 Artificial Intelligence\\nmust be safe and secure.\\u00a0\\nMeeting this goal requires\\nrobust, reliable, repeatable,\\nand standardized evaluations of\\nAI systems, as well as policies,\\ninstitutions, and, as\\nappropriate, other mechanisms to\\ntest, understand, and mitigate\\nrisks from these systems before\\nthey are put to use.\\u00a0 It also\\nrequires addressing AI systems\\u2019\\nmost pressing security risks \\u2014\\nincluding with respect to\\nbiotechnology, cybersecurity,\\ncritical infrastructure, and\\nother national security dangers\\n\\u2014 while navigating AI\\u2019s opacity\\nand complexity.\\u00a0 Testing and\\nevaluations, including post-\\ndeployment performance\\nmonitoring, will help ensure\\nthat AI systems function as\\nintended, are resilient against\\nmisuse or dangerous\\nmodifications, are ethically\\ndeveloped and operated in a\\nsecure manner, and are compliant\\nwith applicable Federal laws and\\npolicies.\\u00a0 Finally, my\\nAdministration will help develop\\neffective labeling and content\\nprovenance mechanisms, so that\\nAmericans are able to determine\\nwhen content is generated using\\nAI and when it is not.\\u00a0 These\\nactions will provide a vital\\nfoundation for an approach that\\naddresses AI\\u2019s risks without\\nunduly reducing its benefits.\",\"(b)\\u00a0 Promoting responsible\\ninnovation, competition, and\\ncollaboration will allow the\\nUnited States to lead in AI and\\nunlock the technology\\u2019s\\npotential to solve some of\\nsociety\\u2019s most difficult\\nchallenges.\\u00a0 This effort\\nrequires investments in AI-\\nrelated education, training,\\ndevelopment, research, and\\ncapacity, while simultaneously\\ntackling novel intellectual\\nproperty (IP) questions and\\nother problems to protect\\ninventors and creators.\\u00a0 Across\\nthe Federal Government, my\\nAdministration will support\\nprograms to provide Americans\\nthe skills they need for the age\\nof AI and attract the world\\u2019s AI\\ntalent to our shores \\u2014 not just\\nto study, but to stay \\u2014 so that\\nthe companies and technologies\\nof the future are made in\\nAmerica.\\u00a0 The Federal Government\\nwill promote a fair, open, and\\ncompetitive ecosystem and\\nmarketplace for AI and related\\ntechnologies so that small\\ndevelopers and entrepreneurs can\\ncontinue to drive innovation.\\u00a0\\nDoing so requires stopping\\nunlawful collusion and\\naddressing risks from dominant\\nfirms\\u2019 use of key assets such as\\nsemiconductors, computing power,\\ncloud storage, and data to\\ndisadvantage competitors, and it\\nrequires supporting a\\nmarketplace that harnesses the\\nbenefits of AI to provide new\\nopportunities for small\\nbusinesses, workers, and\\nentrepreneurs.\",\"(c)\\u00a0 The responsible development\\nand use of AI require a\\ncommitment to supporting\\nAmerican workers.\\u00a0 As AI creates\\nnew jobs and industries, all\\nworkers need a seat at the\\ntable, including through\\ncollective bargaining, to ensure\\nthat they benefit from these\\nopportunities.\\u00a0 My\\nAdministration will seek to\\nadapt job training and education\\nto support a diverse workforce\\nand help provide access to\\nopportunities that AI creates.\\u00a0\\nIn the workplace itself, AI\\nshould not be deployed in ways\\nthat undermine rights, worsen\\njob quality, encourage undue\\nworker surveillance, lessen\\nmarket competition, introduce\\nnew health and safety risks, or\\ncause harmful labor-force\\ndisruptions.\\u00a0 The critical next\\nsteps in AI development should\\nbe built on the views of\\nworkers, labor unions,\\neducators, and employers to\\nsupport responsible uses of AI\\nthat improve workers\\u2019 lives,\\npositively augment human work,\\nand help all people safely enjoy\\nthe gains and opportunities from\\ntechnological innovation.\",\"(d)\\u00a0 Artificial Intelligence\\npolicies must be consistent with\\nmy Administration\\u2019s dedication\\nto advancing equity and civil\\nrights.\\u00a0 My Administration\\ncannot \\u2014 and will not \\u2014 tolerate\\nthe use of AI to disadvantage\\nthose who are already too often\\ndenied equal opportunity and\\njustice.\\u00a0 From hiring to housing\\nto healthcare, we have seen what\\nhappens when AI use deepens\\ndiscrimination and bias, rather\\nthan improving quality of life.\\u00a0\\nArtificial Intelligence systems\\ndeployed irresponsibly have\\nreproduced and intensified\\nexisting inequities, caused new\\ntypes of harmful discrimination,\\nand exacerbated online and\\nphysical harms.\\u00a0 My\\nAdministration will build on the\\nimportant steps that have\\nalready been taken \\u2014 such as\\nissuing the Blueprint for an AI\\nBill of Rights, the AI Risk\\nManagement Framework, and\\nExecutive Order 14091 of\\nFebruary 16, 2023 (Further\\nAdvancing Racial Equity and\\nSupport for Underserved\\nCommunities Through the Federal\\nGovernment) \\u2014 in seeking to\\nensure that AI complies with all\\nFederal laws and to promote\\nrobust technical evaluations,\\ncareful oversight, engagement\\nwith affected communities, and\\nrigorous regulation.\\u00a0 It is\\nnecessary to hold those\\ndeveloping and deploying AI\\naccountable to standards that\\nprotect against unlawful\\ndiscrimination and abuse,\\nincluding in the justice system\\nand the Federal Government.\\u00a0\\nOnly then can Americans trust AI\\nto advance civil rights, civil\\nliberties, equity, and justice\\nfor all.\",\"(e)\\u00a0 The interests of Americans\\nwho increasingly use, interact\\nwith, or purchase AI and AI-\\nenabled products in their daily\\nlives must be protected.\\u00a0 Use of\\nnew technologies, such as AI,\\ndoes not excuse organizations\\nfrom their legal obligations,\\nand hard-won consumer\\nprotections are more important\\nthan ever in moments of\\ntechnological change.\\u00a0 The\\nFederal Government will enforce\\nexisting consumer protection\\nlaws and principles and enact\\nappropriate safeguards against\\nfraud, unintended bias,\\ndiscrimination, infringements on\\nprivacy, and other harms from\\nAI.\\u00a0 Such protections are\\nespecially important in critical\\nfields like healthcare,\\nfinancial services, education,\\nhousing, law, and\\ntransportation, where mistakes\\nby or misuse of AI could harm\\npatients, cost consumers or\\nsmall businesses, or jeopardize\\nsafety or rights.\\u00a0 At the same\\ntime, my Administration will\\npromote responsible uses of AI\\nthat protect consumers, raise\\nthe quality of goods and\\nservices, lower their prices, or\\nexpand selection and\\navailability.\",\"(f)\\u00a0 Americans\\u2019 privacy and\\ncivil liberties must be\\nprotected as AI continues\\nadvancing.\\u00a0 Artificial\\nIntelligence is making it easier\\nto extract, re-identify, link,\\ninfer, and act on sensitive\\ninformation about people\\u2019s\\nidentities, locations, habits,\\nand desires.\\u00a0 Artificial\\nIntelligence\\u2019s capabilities in\\nthese areas can increase the\\nrisk that personal data could be\\nexploited and exposed.\\u00a0 To\\ncombat this risk, the Federal\\nGovernment will ensure that the\\ncollection, use, and retention\\nof data is lawful, is secure,\\nand mitigates privacy and\\nconfidentiality risks.\\u00a0 Agencies\\nshall use available policy and\\ntechnical tools, including\\nprivacy-enhancing technologies\\n(PETs) where appropriate, to\\nprotect privacy and to combat\\nthe broader legal and societal\\nrisks \\u2014 including the chilling\\nof First Amendment rights \\u2014 that\\nresult from the improper\\ncollection and use of people\\u2019s\\ndata.\",\"(g)\\u00a0 It is important to manage\\nthe risks from the Federal\\nGovernment\\u2019s own use of AI and\\nincrease its internal capacity\\nto regulate, govern, and support\\nresponsible use of AI to deliver\\nbetter results for Americans.\\u00a0\\nThese efforts start with people,\\nour Nation\\u2019s greatest asset.\\u00a0 My\\nAdministration will take steps\\nto attract, retain, and develop\\npublic service-oriented AI\\nprofessionals, including from\\nunderserved communities,\\nacross\\u00a0disciplines \\u2014 including\\ntechnology, policy,\\nmanagerial,\\u00a0procurement,\\nregulatory, ethical, governance,\\nand legal fields \\u2014 and ease AI\\nprofessionals\\u2019 path into the\\nFederal Government to help\\nharness and govern AI.\\u00a0 The\\nFederal Government will work to\\nensure that all members of its\\nworkforce receive adequate\\ntraining to understand the\\nbenefits, risks, and limitations\\nof AI for their job functions,\\nand to modernize Federal\\nGovernment information\\ntechnology infrastructure,\\nremove\\u00a0bureaucratic obstacles,\\nand ensure that safe and rights-\\nrespecting AI is adopted,\\ndeployed, and used.\",\"(h)\\u00a0 The Federal Government\\nshould lead the way to global\\nsocietal, economic, and\\ntechnological progress, as the\\nUnited\\u00a0States has in previous\\neras of disruptive innovation\\nand change.\\u00a0 This leadership is\\nnot measured solely by the\\ntechnological advancements our\\ncountry makes.\\u00a0 Effective\\nleadership also means pioneering\\nthose systems and safeguards\\nneeded to deploy technology\\nresponsibly \\u2014 and building and\\npromoting those safeguards with\\nthe rest of the world.\\u00a0My\\nAdministration will engage with\\ninternational allies and\\npartners in developing a\\nframework to manage AI\\u2019s risks,\\nunlock AI\\u2019s potential for good,\\nand promote common approaches to\\nshared challenges.\\u00a0 The Federal\\nGovernment will seek to promote\\nresponsible AI safety and\\nsecurity principles and actions\\nwith other nations, including\\nour competitors, while leading\\nkey global conversations and\\ncollaborations to ensure that AI\\nbenefits the whole world, rather\\nthan exacerbating inequities,\\nthreatening human rights, and\\ncausing other harms.\",\"Sec.3.\\u00a0 Definitions.\\u00a0 For\\npurposes of this order\",\"(a)\\u00a0 The term
