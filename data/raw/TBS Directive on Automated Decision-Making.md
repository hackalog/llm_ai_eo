## Appendix A - Definitions

administrative decision

Any decision that is made by an authorized official of an institution as identified in section 9 of this directive pursuant to powers conferred by an Act of Parliament or an order made pursuant to a prerogative of the Crown that affects legal rights, privileges or interests.

algorithmic impact assessment

A framework to help institutions better understand and reduce the risks associated with automated decision systems and to provide the appropriate governance, oversight and reporting/audit requirements that best match the type of application being designed.

artificial intelligence

Information technology that performs tasks that would ordinarily require biological brainpower to accomplish, such as making sense of spoken language, learning behaviours or solving problems.

automated decision system

Any technology that either assists or replaces the judgment of human decision-makers. These systems draw from fields like statistics, linguistics and computer science, and use techniques such as rules-based systems, regression, predictive analytics, machine learning, deep learning, and neural nets.

procedural fairness
